# Matrix and Array Operations App

Multifunctional application for performing operations on matrices and arrays.

## Description

This project is a multifunctional application programmed in C that enables users to perform various operations on matrices and arrays. It is developed as part of a university class project to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts and data manipulation techniques.

## Operations

1. The sum of the elements on the two diagonals of a matrix
2. Finding the palindrome elements of a vector
3. The sum of the elements under the main diagonal of a matrix
4. Checking if a number is part of a matrix's border
5. Checking if the elements of a vector are in ascending order
6. Determining the highest value that appears in a matrix at least twice
7. Determining the positions of all occurances of a given value in a vector
8. Inserting a value in a vector on a given position
9. Determining how many lines in a matrix have all equal elements
10. Building a matrix of n size in which each element is equal to the sum of the indexes
11. Ordering the lines of a matrix by the sum of their elements
12. Determining the element with the max number of occurances in a matrix
13. Ordering a matrix ascendingly by lines and columns
14. Finding the sums of the elements in the 4 zones delimited by the diagonals of a matrix
15. The multiplication of two matrices
16. Multiplying a matrix with a number
17. Extending a matrix with a line and column where the new elements are the sum of the elements on the respective line/column
18. Separate a matrix in vectors coresponding to each line
19. Reverse the diagonals of a square matrix
20. Display the upper and the lower triangle of a matrix

## Usage

Upon running the application, you will be prompted to select an operation from the provided list. Enter the corresponding number of the operation you wish to perform.

Ensure that you input valid matrices and arrays when prompted. The application includes necessary validations to handle invalid inputs gracefully.
